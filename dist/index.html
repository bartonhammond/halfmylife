For example, have you been married to your spouse or have a significant other or best friend for half of your life? Or maybe you'd like to know the day when your child is half your age? What day would that half way point be?</p><h3>Welcome to Half My Life</h3><p>These questions can be answered by doing some gymnastics with calendars and dates. But you don't have to pull out pencil and paper to figure this out! Welcome to<bold>Half My Life</bold>- a simple way to answer the questions above.</p><h3>How do I use Half My Life?</h3><p>To calculate the date in question, first select the menu option "Calculate". There are two fields to complete, the first is your birthday - just enter the numbers representing your Month, Day and Year. The next field is the date when the relationship started. It can be the date when you met your spouse or significant other. It could be the date your child was born.</p><p>Once you have the two dates entered, press the Calculate key and the key dates or milestones are shown, among them the 50%, or half your life milestone. Note that milestones are on multiples of 10% of your life. It only reports dates that are potentially obtainable, namely those dates that are less then 100 after the significant date. occurred.</p></paper-material></section><section data-route="calculate"><paper-material elevation="1"><calculate-halflife></calculate-halflife></paper-material></section><section data-route="license"><paper-material elevation="1"><h2 class="paper-font-display2">License</h2><paper-material elevation="1" class="paper-font-body2"><p>This software (see source here: <a href="https://github.com/bartonhammond/halfmylife">https://github.com/bartonhammond/halfmylife</a>) is BSD style license unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Copyright (c) 2015 Barton Hammond.
